        <h3> Recipe </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> 
                If using chicken livers, place in a countertop blender and process until smooth. Transfer puréed livers to a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Blot pork shoulder dry with paper towels and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet lined with a double layer of paper towels. In a wok, heat 2 cups (475ml) oil over medium-high heat until it registers 375°F (190°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Working in 3 batches, carefully lower a third of the pork shoulder into the oil and fry until lightly browned all over, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer pork to prepared rack. Return oil to 375°F (190°C) and repeat with remaining pork. Set aside.  
            </li>
            <li> 
                In a 12-inch cast iron skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and golden brown in color, about 3 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add reserved fried pork, puréed chicken livers (if using), soy sauce, calamansi juice, and chiles, and mix until well combined. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Break eggs directly into pan, spacing them evenly around perimeter. Lower heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook, without stirring, until egg whites are opaque and yolks are runny but turning yellow on the edges, about 3 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add scallions and mix with pork and eggs until fully combined. Serve immediately with cooked white rice and calamansi halves. 
            </li>
        </ol>
